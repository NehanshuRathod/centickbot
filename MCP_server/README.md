# Booking MCP Server

This repository contains an **MCP (Model Context Protocol) server** for a booking-based chatbot system.

The MCP server exposes **well-defined tools** that an LLM can call to perform booking-related operations such as fetching bookings, cancelling bookings, checking refund status, and creating support tickets.
