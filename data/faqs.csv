Question,Answer
I’ve not received my eTickets yet from the venue?,"Most venues issue eTickets within 3 hours of the performance beginning. If you have not received yours, we recommend traveling to the venue and checking again once you arrive (via mobile internet). If you still haven’t received your tickets by that point, we suggest that you approach the Box Office and explain the situation and they’ll be happy to help you."
Do you offer telephone support?,"No, we're a small team and need to be able to prioritise our workload.   Please send us a message via email, or our contact form and we’ll get back to you as quickly as we can."
"I have a query about my booking, should I contact the venue directly?","No, you must always direct any enquiries to Central Tickets and never contact the venue directly.  This is an important rule of membership."
I've made a booking for a West End show and I haven't received my booking confirmation.  What should I do?,"Booking confirmations for all shows (whether fulfilled by us, or third-parties) can be found by navigating to My Account > Bookings on our website, or by clicking Account > Tickets on our app."
"If I make a booking for a seat-filling show, will my seats be together?","Yes, you will be seated together if you buy more than one ticket."
How do I find or filter shows that are outside of London?,"If you’re using our website, navigate to Shows then select the dropdown menu that defaults to London, to see other options.  On our app, navigate to Shows, then click Anywhere."
Will I lose my membership if I don't book within 3 months?,Members must now make at least one booking per year to remain a member of Central Tickets (this rule does not apply to Regional members).  There is no charge if you do not make a booking within one year.
"I have access needs, can I join Central Tickets?",Absolutely - Central Tickets is totally inclusive.   See the notes below to understand how best to use Central Tickets.
Access Bookings for Seat-Filling Opportunities,"For seat-filling bookings, get in touch with us so that we can reach out to the venue on your behalf to make sure they can accommodate your needs.
Once we’re aware of your needs, we’ll check with the venue each time to make sure they’re able to seat you.
Should they not be able to accommodate your needs for any reason, we will cancel and refund your booking."
Access Bookings for West End Promotions (external promotions),"Making access bookings for the shows that are fulfilled via third-parties are more complex because we are an agent and do not have direct access to inventory to make sure your needs can be met.  The current advice that Today Tix Group provide is stated below:
In most cases, the best thing to do is book directly with the theatre, but our team will be happy to find the contact details you need if you write to us and tell us which show you are trying to book for.
If you have access needs such as visual, hearing or have any other disability, we want to help make your booking process as smooth as possible whilst meeting all of your needs. Currently we are able to make access bookings for all Lloyd Webber Theatre Group venues, a list of which follows:
Adelphi Theatre
Gillian Lynne Theatre
Cambridge Theatre
His Majesty’s Theatre
Theatre Royal Drury Lane
The London Palladium
For any other venue, we advise booking directly with the venue. This is to ensure we get your theatre experience just right. The venue staff are equipped with all the right knowledge to ensure you get the perfect seat according to your needs."
Is membership free?,"Yes, membership is completely free so long as you make one booking for a seat-filling show every 12 months.  If you do not make a booking every 12-months, your access to seat-filling opportunities will become restricted.  There is no financial penalty if you do not make the required number of bookings."
